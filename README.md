# HungryKnight

The game is a turn-based puzzle centered around a knight navigating a chessboard to capture all enemy pawns. Each board presents a generated puzzle where the knight must move strictly using legal knight moves and may only land on squares occupied by pawns. Moving to an empty square is considered an invalid move and immediately ends the game, reinforcing the core rule that every action must result in a capture. The objective of each board is to eliminate all pawns before the timer runs out, after which the next board is generated with increased difficulty.

Boards are procedurally generated to ensure that each puzzle is solvable and offers at least one valid capture path. The game ends when the player runs out of time or makes an invalid move. To prevent unwinnable states without undermining the puzzle structure, the game introduces a limited extra pawn mechanic: when the knight has no available capture moves, the player may spend an extra pawn to place a new pawn on an empty square, restoring possible moves. This mechanic is tightly constrained and clearly communicated through the UI, ensuring it functions as a strategic recovery tool rather than a bypass. Together, these systems create a focused puzzle experience that emphasizes planning, spatial reasoning, and disciplined decision-making.

# Design Decisions: Difficulty, Rewards, and Penalties

Difficulty in the game is designed to scale gradually through board progression rather than through mechanical complexity. As the player clears boards, the board size and number of enemy pawns increase, naturally expanding the search space for valid knight moves and increasing cognitive load. This ensures that early boards teach core mechanics in a safe environment, while later boards challenge the player’s planning and foresight without introducing new rules. Time pressure further reinforces difficulty by encouraging efficient decision-making as levels progress.

The reward and penalty systems are built to reinforce skillful play instead of random experimentation. Capturing pawns is the primary objective, while time bonuses are granted on board completion to sustain momentum. Every five cleared boards, the player earns an extra pawn, a limited resource that can be strategically placed when no capture moves are available. This system acts as a safety valve rather than a shortcut: the extra pawn is only usable when the player is truly stuck, and its availability is clearly communicated through the UI. Penalties are immediate and readable—moving to a non-capture square or running out of time results in a game over—ensuring that each action carries clear consequences and reinforcing deliberate, thoughtful play.
